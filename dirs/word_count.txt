A friend is someone who can let you feel
warm when you are depressed. I have many
friends. However I only have one best friend and
it's XXX. He is the same age as me. He is taller
than me. Basketball is his favourite sport.
We are in the same class. He likes studying and is good at it,
so he gets high marks. We learn from each other and help each other.
He will help me if I ever get into troubles. So will I. I hope our friendship will last forever and ever
